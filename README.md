*"I never wanted this, I never wanted to unleash my legions. Together we banished the ignorance of Old Night, but you betrayed me, you betrayed us all. You stole power from the Gods and lied to your sons. Mankind has only one chance to prosper, if you will not seize it then I will. So let it be war, from the skies of Terra to the Galactic rim. Let the seas boil, let the stars fall. Though it takes the last drop of my blood, I will see the galaxy freed once more and if I cannot save it from your failure Father, then let the galaxy burn!"*
                                                                                                                                                                                 *-Horus Lupercal during the Horus Heresy.*
                                                                                                                                                                                    
**Background:**

The Horus Heresy was a galaxy-spanning civil war that pitted half of the Space Marine Legions against their God Emperor. Horus Lupercal, and fellow primarchs turned traitor, seduced by the Chaos Gods. 
The ensuing conflict was a brutal and bloody war that nearly destroyed the Imperium of Man. The Heresy ended with Horus's defeat, but the scars of the war still haunt the galaxy.

**Part I: The Beginning**
![20 Primarchs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0cead94-7f98-421f-a22e-1a4f3ccd416d)

The Emperor of Mankind has created 20 genetically-engineered super humans for the sole purpose of conquering the galaxy, through the use of his DNA and technologies created deep beneath the Himalayan mountains. With these 20 sons of the Emperor, they’ll lead his armies into space and reunite all the scattered human colonies. 
 
  The Dark Gods of Chaos however anticipated this act and plotted together in order to prevent the God Emperor from achieving this, thus when the primarchs (collective name for the Emperor’s sons) are still in their infant stage and in a capsule. The Dark Gods have opened a warp storm and hurled the primarchs into different sectors of the universe.
   
  Horus Lupercal, one of the first to be founded by the Emperor and due to his lineage as a direct descendant of the Emperor he was already matured and already a commendable figure. The Emperor gave his son his army which is made by the residue of their primarch’s gene-seed thus forming a Grandfather-Father-Son relationship. 
 
**Part II: The Great Crusade**
![Proclamation of Warmaster](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48ae88a1-babf-4324-a6ec-2f02bd74eebd)

The God Emperor, Horus Lupercal, and their armies march together and conquer the stars and celestial bodies, one by one. They eventually discover all the primarchs with their own world already bend to their will as their intellect, charisma, and might are otherworldly. Each of them bend their knee to the God Emperor although some were more unwilling than others.
   
A great orc tide from every corners of the known galaxy however was approaching Terra due to the will of their twin gods Gork and Mork. The God Emperor, Horus, and the nearest primarchs were recalled in order to fight this incoming threat which were dubbed as the “War of the Beast”. This beast however was not a singular entity but rather five orc war chiefs which have the same power and cunning as a primarch if not better but still bestial in nature. 
   
The Emperor of Mankind was wounded in battle by one of these beast and once the orc is going to deliver the death blow, Horus swiftly decapitates its head and saves his father. From this deed, the Emperor of Mankind proclaimed Horus as the “Warmaster” which will lead and plan the entire great crusade in place of his father. Horus though was amicable at first, he still can’t shake the feeling that his Father isn’t going to join his and his brothers side anymore.

**Part III: The Humiliation of Lorgar**

  One of the primarchs named Lorgar Aurelian was the most devoted and willing son of the Emperor however for this faith, he’ll only received shame and ignominy from his fellow brothers. Fate will have him shunned from the eyes of his fellow primarchs and only punishment is his reward. The Dark Gods have planned to use him and his faith in order to corrupt the most favored son of the Emperor.
   
  Lorgar though was a man of compliance and willingly follow the order and will of the Emperor, was one of the slowest primarchs in conquering planets. His ideologies and creed clashes with the Emperor with him revering him as a God and the Emperor’s ideologies of “The Imperial Truth” from which it forbids magic, idolization, and accomplishments through science is only the truth. 
   
  The Emperor kept a blind eye on Lorgar’s devotion however with every time passing and his conquers were lagging behind his brothers. The Emperor called for Guilliman, one of his sons who’s made to be a model because of his achievements and management of his territory. The Emperor and Guilliman marched onto Monachia which is the capital home-world of Lorgar. From there, the God Emperor’s psychic might bend the knee of Lorgar and his sons. He ordered Guillliman to start tearing down the walls of the city and the statues of the God Emperor, Guilliman however was troubled but nonetheless followed through the orders of his Father.
   
  This started what was known as “The Pilgrimage of Lorgar”, which was a 40-day pilgrimage of Lorgar and his sons to other worlds in order to seek other gods for his devotion. He comes across a world where the tribes were worshipping beings that grant them powers and heals them from their ailments. These gods however were the Chaos Gods and the tribespeople as their followers. Intrigued by these gods, Lorgar willingly gave his devotion to them from which the Chaos Gods can start corrupting him and his other brothers.
   
**Part IV: Horus Rising**

Horus was deep in his thoughts on why the God Emperor gave him the entire command of the crusade and retreated deep into the Himalayas. He pondered that question every time he’s not conquering a planet. If he doesn’t even trust his most favored Son, then what else is the reason for all of their conquest? 
 
Lorgar stalked Horus as he conquered worlds, after he finished conquering a hard-fought world from other xenos. He eventually contacted Horus under the guise of pacifying a world but rather a plan by him and the Dark Gods to corrupt Horus.
 
Horus with his compassion and mercy towards Lorgar, agreed to help his brother in conquering the world. Horus failed to realize the dark plans that his brother had for him, in the battle he was greatly injured that were caused by chaos-infected sword. Horus’s army which is his sons cried for help towards Lorgar and Lorgar brought them to a world that is said can heal their Father.


**Part V: Corruption of the Mind**

  They brought Horus deep within a temple, and from their none knows what have transpired and happened but Horus came out fully revitalized and rejuvenated from his injuries. Even astonished that he had gain additional strength that was on par or even greater than his most physically strongest brother. 
  
  In truth, the Dark Gods have already made him their pawn without him knowing, they whispered temptations, lies, and deceptions. Feeding him his already confused mind with thoughts of rebellion and that the God Emperor has left them. Thoughts of humanity being a violent theocratic selfish and repressive society. Horus seek out Magnus the Red, one of his primarch brothers that excels in magic to confirm if his visions are true.
  
  The Dark Gods portrayed themselves as pure beings and only wanted to prevent the downfall of Humanity towards Horus and shows him those visions. Ironically these visions were made by the Warmaster once he’s fully corrupted by chaos. Magnus said to Horus that these visions are one of the future outcomes that can be prevented.
  
  Horus already blinded by the Chaos Gods, desire for power and anger at what he thought his Father abandoning him in the Great Crusade. Accepted the pact of the Chaos Gods from which he thought he’ll deliver peace and prosperity towards Mankind in exchange for disposing the God Emperor. 

**Part VI: Horus Heresy**

Lorgar welcomed Horus and together they’ve planned to gather their brothers that have a grudge against their Father or that’s susceptible to chaos. 
  
He sought out Angron from the World Eaters for his anger towards their Father in failing to save his friend and brothers in arms which made him easily a slave of anger by Khorne. 

Fulgrim from the Emperor’s Children for he was already jaded, capricious and excessive towards himself and his pursuits of perfections corrupted by Slaanesh. 

Alpharius Omegon, a twin primarch who’s deeds and intentions are unknown. Only that their reason for joining Horus is what they think for the greater good.

Mortarion of the Death Guard, he was a primarch that was riddled by sickness and decay by long wars, his sons prayed for a miracle in which Nurgle gleefully answers. 

Curze of the Night Lords, torn by his nightmarish visions and endless suffering of his homeworld. He reluctantly joined Horus in order to end his own suffering.

Perturabo a primarch of the Iron Warriors who’s in rivalry of another primarch named Rogal Dorn. He was deprived of affection from his Father and seeks the approval of his brothers easily joins Horus.

Once he gathered all of his traitor primarchs, he made a plan for he was outnumbered 3-1 when all of their armies combined. He tasked 3 of the loyalist armies and their primarchs in conquering a world known as Istvaan – III which was filled by demonic entities that were released by the Dark Gods of Chaos. Coined as the start of Horus Heresy, Loyalists elements within the traitor primarchs were dropped into the planet from which they were virus-bomb from orbit. This results in the deaths of a multitude of loyalist legionnaires. However, a lone Emperor’s Children loyalist, had a terrible hunch and remained within the fleet, when he saw the virus bombing of Istvaan – III he quickly boarded a small vessel and fled while being pursued.
  
  Horus then renounced his oath to his Father and openly rebelled in Istvaan – V. There he waited the response from his Father, not knowing that he already corrupted half of the primarchs. The Emperor’s Children loyalist managed to get into Magnus the Red’s capital home world of Prospero and relay his message to the rebellion of Horus. Magnus in his arrogance, recklessness and selfish pride projects a psychic imagery which penetrates the defensive barriers of the God Emperor’s laboratory in the Himalayas. 
  
  Due to this, the God Emperor has created the council of Nikea which banned all magic and further shunned Magnus. The God Emperor orders Leman Russ and his Space Wolves to capture and return him to Earth as he does not believe his son Horus is betraying them. Horus however already conceived a plan in order to get Magnus in to his side. He hijacks the communications of Leman Russ and says to him that the God Emperor orders for the burning of his city dubbed as “The Burning of Prospero”. This led to Magnus the Red in siding with Horus although this was because of the arrogance of Magnus and deceit of Horus.
  
  The God Emperor also has ordered the greatest concentration of space fleets in the history of human kind, far greater than what was gathered in the War of the Beast. It was made up of the Night Lords, Salamanders, Alpha Legion, Raven Guard, Iron Hands, Emperor’s Children, Blood, Angels, Word Bearers. The remaining legionnaires were sent on a different mission and are too far away from Earth to respond. The Loyalist Legionnaires didn’t know the treachery of their brothers and only knew the full extent of the betrayal when the Salamanders, Iron Hands, and Blood Angels dropped onto the battlefield and fought a massive battle against Horus, his legions, and demonic entities. Only when they retreated to their lines where they were gunned down by the traitor legions. Vulkan primarch of the Salamanders and Sanguinius primarch of the Blood Angels managed to survived whereas Ferrus Manus is unlucky as his head were decapitated by former best friend Fulgrim.
 
No one knew what was the full scale of the treachery, until Sanguinius manages to reach Guilliman. Vulkan was hunted by the traitor primarchs and his ship struck down, his whereabouts unknown. Guilliman and Sanguineous reconvened and sent a message towards Earth, Guilliman and his legionnaires where the largest among the primarchs and he part ways with Sanguinius to gather all of his legions. 
 
The God Emperor has recalled all remaining loyalist primarchs so that they can prepare for the incoming battle of Earth against Horus. Horus knowing that they’ll be at a disadvantage sent the Alpha Legion to intercept Guilliman and his Ultramarines Legionnaire from reaching Earth. They made a blitz-krieg towards Earth and siege it for a whole month.



**Part VII: Death of an Empire**

The battle begins with a torrential rainfall of void bombardments, flak cannons were targeting incoming missiles and void shield protecting Earth from the entire fleet of Horus. Landfall was only made after Horus having his patience tested to its limits lunch one of the larger ship of his fleet into the void shield which destroys both the ship and the void shield.  
  
What follows was a series of wave attacks made by the Traitor Legions though their numbers and powers were great, there was no cohesion and each have their own agendas. What’s worst is that Lorgar in his pride and ego thought he deserved much more openly rebel against Horus taking a significant amount of his fleet and fleeing the battle. The battle however was going on Horus’ side and the God Emperor made a desperate gamble in order to win against Horus.
  
With a thought of his head, the God Emperor, Sanguinius and his legion of elite guards teleported inside Horus’s ship called The Vengeful Spirit. Due to the psychic protection made by the Dark Gods of Chaos, they were scattered around the ship. The God Emperor can however telepathically command them to rush towards the center of the ship where Horus is residing in order to slay him.
    
Sanguinius were the first to arrive, his might and skill are strong but it’s no match for the chaotic might of Horus who were fueled by the Dark Gods. His angelic appearance was all but destroyed and his great wings disheveled from all the blood and injuries. When Horus finally delivered the death blow to his brother, then the God Emperor came.

Seeing how Sanguinius broken and in a pool of blood. The God Emperor flew into a rage but still were unavailable to reach Horus. The God Emperor was brutally beaten and thrown around the room. Only when he comes face to face with Sanguinius’s face is when he wills himself that blinds Horus and struck his own son down with his full psychic might. However, it comes with a price as releasing all of his powers will kill him. It was then when the God Emperor stabbed his most favored son Horus is when Horus shed a tear and realized that he was manipulated by the Dark Gods. The God Emperor knew Horus will be a pawn of chaos in the future, he gave him a true death so that his soul and spirit will forever die and will never be reborn. Thus the Horus Heresy has ended.
